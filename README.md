## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is an iterative,flexible and collaborative approachbto project management and software development.
It focuses on delivering small,incremental improvements through short development cycles and allows frequent changes based on stakeholder feedback.
Waterfall is a traditional,linear approach where each phase of the project must be completed before moving to the next.
It follows a sequential process.
 DIFFERENCES
 a)Agile has an iterative and incremental approach while waterfall has linear and sequential approach.
 b)Agile is highly flexible and adapts to changes while waterfal is rigid and changes are difficult to accomodate.
 c)Project phases overlap in agile while in waterfall the phases are distinct and msut be completed one after another.
 d)In agile customer involvemnet is continuous and feedback is welcomed throughout the project whereas in waterfall there is limited customer involvement
 and is mainly during initial requirements gathering and final delivery
 e)In agile the deleiverables are frequent and small while in waterfall there is final deliverble at the end of the project
 f)Documentation is less emphasized while is waterfall heavy documentation is emphasized.
  ADVANTAGES OF AGILE
  a) Its flexible and adaptable.
  b)Customer collaboration -  regular communication with stakeholders ensures the product aligns with their needs and expectations.
  c)Faster time to market
  d)Improved risk management
  e)Higher quality

  DISADVANTAGES
  a)Less predictability
  b)Requires high engagement
  c)Scalability issues
  d)Limited documentation
   
     ADVANTAGES OF WATERFALL
  a)Clear structure and phases
  b)Predictability
  c)Thorough documentation
  d)Ideal for well defined projects   
  DISADVANTAGES
  a)Does not accomodate changes once the project has began
  b)there is late testing which is done after development is complete so issues are found later in the process.
  c)Slow to deliver value
  d)Higher risk of failure
  
 

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is suitable for dynamic environment and continuous improvement projects while waterfall is suitable for well defined requiremenets and projects with strict deadlines.
WHEN AGILE IS MORE BENEFICIAL
A)Software development-agile allows for frequent updates and improvements ensuring that final product evolves based on user feedback.
b)Marketing campaigns-campaigns that require frequent adjustments to the messaging,targeting, or channels benefit from agile.
c)Product development-in industries like tech startups,where market demands and customer feedback are constantly changing,agile helps ensure the product meest customer needs while evolving quickly.

WHEN WATERFALL IS MORE BENEFICIAL
A)Construction projects-waterfal is effective in building contruction because the project has clear stages  and changes after the planning phase can be exepensive and complex.
b)Manufacturing-when designing products,like consumer electronics.where engineering specification are tightly defined and cannot cahnge drastically after the desiggn phase
c)Government or regulatory projects-projects that have strict compliance requirements like public infrastructure.



## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
A)automated testing
i)unit testing-which involves testing individual components or functions to ensure the work as expected
ii)integration testing-ensures that different components of the system work together.
iii)UI testing-automates testing of user interfaces
iv)continuous integration tools-such as Jenkins,CircleCI and GitHub actions can run tests automatically whenever code changes are made.
B)Manual testing
i)exploratory testing-this explores the application without predefined scripts to identify unexpected issues.
ii)refression testing-ensures that new changes do not negatively affect existing functionality.
ii)User Acceptance Testing-involves the actual end users to validate that the software meets their expectations and requirements
C)Code reviews-ensures that best practices ,coding standards and quality expectations are adherred
D)Static code analysis-tools like SonarQube and ESLint analyze and code for potential errors,security vulnerabilities and adherence to coding standards without executing the program
E)Test Driven Development-involves writing tests before writing the actual code.
F)Performance testing-tools like LoadRunner and Apache Jmeter simulate heavy loads on the application to ensure it performs well.
G)Continuous Deployment and Monitoring-automating deployment and monitoring in production allows teams to identify and fix issues in real time
H)Documentation and Standards-maintaining detailed documentation for both the software and testing processes helps set clear expectations and ensure consistency across the development process.
